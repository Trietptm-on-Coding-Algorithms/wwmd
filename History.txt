* lots happening between here and .9
* viewstate refactor complete
* clean up page/page.rb
* cleaning up page/headers.rb
* cleaning up page/scrape.rb
* FormArray refactor includes the form action (full URL)
  * page.submit(page.get_form)
* still bugs in URLParse but hunting them down throw by throw
* remove broken NTLM (preserve auth header warnings)
* remove WWMDConfig in favor of WWMD module methods but preserve old class for back compat
* add some burp helpers
  * Page#from_paste (take entire request into Page and turn off cookies)
  * burp log parsing coming
* Curb includes http_put (with header munging bug so careful)
* internal monkey patch for Curb to do arbitrary verb tampering (not here yet)
* add String#pbcopy
* move lots of things around for clarity during refactor
* refactor progressing but still unstable (2.0.16 gem including viewstate is good to go)
